Debian-specific modifications are found in debian/patches in the source
directory and are applied *at*build*time* by the "debian/rules patch"
makefile rule.  Make sure you apply all these patches if you're trying
to look at the source to the actual binaries included on a Debian
system.

This package will be converted to a dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format at
some point in the future.
