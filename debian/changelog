iputils (20001110-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: Bug#80250, Bug#80251)
  * Removed most of the Debian patches: too much has changed upstream to
    reasonably forward port them. Maxwait argument thus
    disappeared. (Closes: Bug#65597)
  * Shouldn't have any security problems, theoretically. (Closes: Bug#69472)
  * Descriptions have been updated a while ago. (Closes: Bug#68973)

  * Orphaned, maintainer set to debian-qa.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Aug 2000 20:25:21 +1000

iputils (990107-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop priority to extra (it conflicts: with a standard package so
    shouldn't be optional anway), and add a note to the description. 

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Aug 2000 23:49:58 +1000

iputils (990107-1) unstable; urgency=low
