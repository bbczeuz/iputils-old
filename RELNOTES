* ping is able to select TOS. By Pekka Savola <pekkas@netcore.fi>
* tracepath* DNS names. By Pawel Krawczyk <kravietz@ceti.com.pl> and
  Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.org.pl>
* ping6 is expected to be compiled with linux-2.2.

[001011]
* RH bugid#16677: segfault, when ping is used by root and size
  is large enough. Fix is to allow oversize by root (it is necessary
  to check kernel side), but clamp it at some safe value.

[001010]
* More bug fixes from Chris Evans <chris@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk>
  - do not trust h_length returned by system resolver.
    This value is meaningless in any case.
  - ping: buffer overflow in fill()!!! Disgraceful bug.

* ping: allow not-priviledged users to use broadcasts. It was paranoia.
  Multicasts were allowed. 8)
* ping: but force broadcasts&multicasts not to fragment. BSD does
  not allow to do this to anyone, we still allow this for superuser.
* Option -M to control path mtu discovery.

[001007]
* By Pekka Savola <pekkas@netcore.fi>
  - SIOCGSTAMP/SO_TIMESTAMP are sensitive to bug in kernel.
    When get_fast_time != gettimeofday (f.e. timestampless x86),
    returned stamp can be out of sync with gettimeofday.
    Workaround is not to use SIOCGSTAMP/SO_TIMESTAMP on such systems.
  - fixes in man pages
  - compiles under rh-7.0
* Chris Evans <chris@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk>
  - ping: possible buffer overflow in pr_addr().

[000928]
* Sorry. I have lost all the CVS with changes made since 000418.
  If someone sent me a patch after this date, please, resubmit.
  Restored from the last backup and mailboxes:

* ping*, SO_TIMESTAMP support.
* ping*, allow zero data length (reported by Damjan Lango <damjan.lango@hermes.si>)
* iputils man and help updates. Pekka Savola <Pekka.Savola@netcore.fi>
* ping.8, fix to ping man page. By Dadid Eisner <cradle@glue.umd.edu>
* ping prints addresses in numeric, if destination is numeric.
  Proposed by Tim Waugh <twaugh@meme.surrey.redhat.com>

New:
* ping: strncpy bug <typo@inferno.tusculum.edu>
* arping: improvements by Charles Howes <croot@micro-logistics.com>
	- a feature to arping: quit as soon as a reply is received.
	- default to eth0.
	- spelling

[000418]
* llsqrt() was buggy again!
       (noticed by Sam Farin <sfarin@ratol.fi>)

[000404]
* tracepath*, "NURDUnet-gw" bug workaround.
	(noticed by Vitaly E.Lavrov <lve@aanet.ru>)
* tracepath*, handle case of routers initializing rtt to 128.
	Vitaly E.Lavrov <lve@aanet.ru>
* shadowed icmp_sock in ping6. James Morris <jmorris@@intercode.com.au>
* Bug in ping -f, introduced with SO_RCVTIMEO. me.
* llsqrt() (ping, ping6) was wrong yet. me.

[000310]
* Print mean deviation of RTT in ping/ping6.
* Use SIOCGSTAMP in ping/ping6. Old behaviour calculating
  true user-to-user latency is restored with option -U.
  Reason for this stupid change is mainly political; people
  wonder why freebsd has twice less latency on loopback.
  If to follow along this line, we have to print rtt equal to 0. 8)
  [ LATER NOTE: actually, the change is _right_ without any doubts.
    Ping has another bug: nameresolver is blocking, so that
    when it dies not respond, ping shows evenly increasing by 1 sec
    RTT. It is very confusing (look through linux-kernel maillists
    to count number of people, who were cheated by misconfigured dns). ]
* Use SO_RCVTIMEO instead of poll() with ping/ping6 -f.
* Added -V option to arping/ping/ping6/traceroute6/rdisc
  to print snapshot number.

[000305]
* rdisc: ugly bug in getting interface list. me.
* ping/ping6: ping -i N, N>=3 did not work. Jeff Jonson <jbj@redhat.com>
* ping/ping6: microsecond rtt measurements. me.

[000120]
* ping/ping6: non-zero exit code even without -w.

[991024]
* Option "-i" to ping/ping6 takes fractional time now, so that
  "ping -i 0.3 xxx" pings each 300 msec. The idea is by
  Marc Boucher <marc@mbsi.ca>
* alpha/glibc-2.1 alignment problems in ping are fixed (struct timeval
  was wrongly aligned).

[990915]
* ping/ping6 worked only with kernels 2.3.15+ in 990824.

[990824]
* tftpd is added. It uses MSG_CONFIRM to confirm arp entries.
* ping6: workaround for bug in some egcs versions.

[990610]
* ping: output buffer was too small for full sized ping.
* ping: silly restriction on ping size is removed.

[990530]
* short man pages (Oleg M. Shumsky <oms@cp.tomsk.su>)
* ping6: get and print hop limit of reply packets (ME)
* rdisc deletes routes before exit with -TERM
* ping/ping6: option -w TIMEOUT 
* arping: exit with error, if received no replies in normal
  (not DAD and not unsilicited ARP) mode.
